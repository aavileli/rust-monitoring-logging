# Rust Monitoring and Logging

_Week 2 of Rust for DevOps_

This repository is part of the Rust for DevOps course:

- [week 1](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-setup) 
- [week 2](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-monitoring-logging) ðŸ‘ˆ You are here!
- [week 3](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-systems-programming/) 
- [week 4](https://github.com/alfredodeza/advanced-ci-cd-concepts)


## Example project: Redact Personal Identifiable information as a service

This example project will allow you to explore how to add and enable different logging and monitoring tecnhiques to a Rust project. The simple microservice accepts a JSON string as input to the `/redact` endpoint and return a JSON string with the PII redacted based on regular expressions stored as JSON.

This project is part of a course on Rust For DevOps which will teach you how to use Rust while you learn DevOps principles like logging, testing, monitoring, automation, CI/CD, containers, and deployment.

## Contents
This course is divided into three lessons, each covering different aspects of Rust programming. This week has several examples located in the [./examples](./examples) directory. Make sure you have Rust installed and you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza).

This repository is *Codespaces ready*, and it is set as a template repository. You can create a new repository from this template and start working on your own with Codespaces. This means that Rust, Copilot, and all the extensions are already installed and configured for you.
